## Expressions vs Statements

- An expression can be content to just produce a value, which can then be used by the enclosing code.
- A statement stands on its own, so it amounts to something only if it _affects the world._
  - It could display something on the screenâ€”that counts as changing the world.
  - it could change the internal state of the machine in a way that will affect the statements that come after it.
